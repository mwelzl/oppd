Abstract

   [ Please add something to this draft, and then add your name to the
   author list.  Also, consider the draft title: it now indicates that
   I'm the primary dude here (is that really justified?), and that we
   target PANRG.  Should it carry a different name? ]

   This document surveys possibilities for on-path proxy discovery.  It
   is meant to help the conversation in a planned side meeting at
   IETF-121 in Dublin.

1.  Introduction

   Proxies can carry out functions that improve the performance of an
   end-to-end connection.  These function can be quite diverse, ranging
   from minimal help (e.g. just offering information) to more
   significant interference, e.g. splitting an end-to-end connection in
   half, for reliability, congestion control or both.

   It is commonly desirable for such proxies to be located on the
   path(s) that a connection already traverses, rather than using a
   tunneling method to enforce a path.  This is naturally the case for
   transparent "Performance Enhancing Proxies" (PEPs) that have been
   implemented for TCP, but the transparent nature of such proxies has
   caused a number of known problems in the past.  Non-transparent
   proxies leave the choice of utilizing and configuring a performance
   enhancing function to end systems -- and such a choice requires a
   means to detect the proxy and explicitly communicate with it.

   There are various ways in which on-path proxies can be discovered,
   and they differ from the ways in which end systems learn about
   proxies that are not necessarily on-path.

   This document surveys some possibilities that are available for on-
   path proxy discovery.  It is meant to serve as a starting point
   towards the design of approaches to do so.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  A survey of possibilities

   TODO.  The idea is to describe the method in our two research papers
   (see README), and others we know of.

4.  A survey of open issues

   Just an idea, having a separate list of common problems to be
   considered might be helpful.  For example:

   *  How to handle multiple devices on a path?

   *  How to deal with multi-path?

   This list will become longer as we add mechanisms to the preceding
   section.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
