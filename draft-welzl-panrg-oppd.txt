Abstract

   [ Please add something to this draft, and then add your name to the
   author list.  Also, consider the draft title: it now indicates that
   I'm the primary dude here (is that really justified?), and that we
   target PANRG.  Should it carry a different name? ]

   This document surveys possibilities for On-Path Proxy Discovery
   (OPPD).  It is meant to help the conversation in a planned side
   meeting at IETF-121 in Dublin.

1.  Introduction

   Proxies can carry out functions that improve the performance of an
   end-to-end connection.  These function can be quite diverse, ranging
   from minimal help (e.g. just offering information) to more
   significant interference, e.g. splitting an end-to-end connection in
   half, for reliability, congestion control or both.

   It is commonly desirable for such proxies to be located on the
   path(s) that a connection already traverses, rather than using a
   tunneling method to enforce a path.  This is naturally the case for
   transparent "Performance Enhancing Proxies" (PEPs) that have been
   implemented for TCP, but the transparent nature of such proxies has
   caused a number of known problems in the past.  Non-transparent
   proxies leave the choice of utilizing and configuring a performance
   enhancing function to end systems -- and such a choice requires a
   means to detect the proxy and explicitly communicate with it.  With
   QUIC, the encryption of packet headers necessitates using non-
   transparent instead of transparent proxies, and research works such
   as the Sidekick [Sidekick] and Secure Middlebox-Assisted QUIC (SMAQ)
   [SMAQ] have shown that this is both possible and beneficial.

   There are various ways in which On-Path Proxy Discovery (OPPD) can
   work, and they differ from the ways in which end systems learn about
   proxies that are not necessarily on-path.

   This document surveys some possibilities that are available for OPPD.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   *  Base connection: an end-to-end connection between two endpoints on
      which an on-path proxy is expect to carry out a performance-
      improving function.

   *  Endpoint: an entity that communicates with one or more other
      endpoints using a specific transport protocol.  It is locally
      identified by the 5-tuple of IP address pair, protocol and port
      numbers.

4.  General assumptions

   *  On-path proxy devices are expected to carry out functions in
      relation to a base connection.  Thus, they must be on the same
      path, which means that communication with them must use the same
      5-tuple as the base connection.

   *  Endpoint initiation: OPPD must be initiated by an endpoint.
      First, in the presence of NATs, this is the only way to ensure
      that communication with the proxy use the same IP addresses and
      port numbers as the base connection.  Second, in this way,
      endpoints can execute some kind of flow control to avoid the
      reception of many unsolicited announcements.

   *  Proxies must somehow prove that they are on-path, perhaps akin to
      the way it is done with several ICMP messages, by including the
      first 64 bits of the original packet that evoked them [RFC792].
      This establishes a certain minimal level of trust, since on-path
      devices are in the position to do whatever they want with a
      connection's packets anyway -- for example discard, rate-limit or
      duplicate them.

5.  A survey of possibilities

   Please insert your ideas below -- or add a description of a scheme
   that already exists.

5.1.  Endpoint to proxy

5.1.1.  Special packet of base connection

   Sidekick [Sidekick] endpoints signal proxy support by sending a
   distinguished packet containing a 128-byte sidekick-request marker.
   Such inline signaling could confuse receiving endpoints, but
   sidekicks target protocols such as QUIC that discard
   cryptographically unauthenticated data anyway.

   Secure Middlebox-Assisted QUIC [SMAQ] leaves the design of a proxy
   discovery solution as future work, but also suggests to multiplex the
   necessary signaling over the same 5-tuple as the base connection.
   The paper mentions that, in this case, "an open problem still to
   overcome is the possible collision of Connection IDs".

5.1.2.  Header options

   An endpoint could use a newly defined TCP option or a UDP option
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] to signal proxy support.  Such an option
   could be defined to be ignored by the receiving endpoint, and
   receiving endpoints that are not upgraded to support the option
   should ignore it anyway.  In case of QUIC, for example, the QUIC
   implementation at the receiving endpoint would not even be informed
   about the message in the option.  This approach might have the
   advantage of not possibly confusing the receiving endpoint, and it
   does not require the endhost to send an additional packet.

5.2.  Proxy to endpoint

5.2.1.  Special packet of base connection

   A sidekick proxy replies to a sidekick-request packet by sending a
   special packet from the receiver's IP address and port number back to
   the endpoint [Sidekick].  This packet contains a sidekick-reply
   marker, an opaque session ID, and an IP address and port number for
   communicating with the proxy.  Upon receiving the sidekick-reply
   packet, the sender begins communicating directly with the proxy from
   a different UDP port.  It initially sends back the session ID and
   configuration parameters to start receiving quACKs (special ACKs
   crafted by a Sidekick proxy).

5.2.2.  Header options

   A proxy could use insert a newly defined TCP option or a UDP option
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] in a returning packet (e.g., an ACK) to
   answer back to the endpoint that originally announced its proxy
   support.  This approach does not require the proxy to send an
   additional packet.

6.  A survey of open issues

   Just an idea, having a separate list of common problems to be
   considered might be helpful.  For example:

   *  How to handle multiple proxies on a path?

   *  How to deal with multi-path?

      -  Suggestion (Michael): we ignore it, we just apply the discovery
         per path.  Endpoints are expected to initiate the discovery
         process for every path at which they want to make use of a
         proxy should a proxy be available.

   This list will become longer as we add mechanisms to the preceding
   section.

7.  Examined material that was not included

   [I-D.kuehlewind-quic-proxy-discovery] lists several possibilities for
   proxy discovery, but the proxies in question need not be on-path.
   One notable possibility mentioned in
   [I-D.kuehlewind-quic-proxy-discovery] document is the use of PCP;
   this is, in some sense, an on-path discovery method since NATs are
   necessarily on-path.  However, there is no reason to limit the
   discovery process described in the present document to scenarios with
   NATs only.

8.  Security Considerations

   TODO.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
