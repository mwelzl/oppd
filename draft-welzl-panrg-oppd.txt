1.  Introduction

   Proxy systems can carry out functions that improve the performance of
   an end-to-end connection; this includes to just offer information.
   To do this, it is usually desirable for such systems to be located on
   the path(s) that the connection traverses.  This is naturally the
   case for transparent "Performance Enhancing Proxies" (PEPs) that have
   been implemented for TCP, but transparent nature of such proxies has
   caused a number of known problems in the past.  Non-transparent
   proxies leave the choice of utilizing and configuring a performance
   enhancing function to end systems - and such choice requires a
   signaling channel to detect the proxy and communicate with it.

   For protocols such as QUIC, where encryption prevents proxies from
   transparently interfering with traffic, or when performance enhancing
   proxy functions are desired, chosen and configured by an end system,

   There are various ways in which on-path proxies can be discovered,
   and they differ from the ways in which end systems learn about
   proxies that are not necessarily on-path.

   This document is meant to serve as a starting point towards the
   design of approaches to discover on-path proxies by surveying some
   possibilities that are available.
