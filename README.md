# On-Path Proxy Discovery (OPPD)

This is the starting point for an IETF activity on on-path proxy discovery.


---

* If you're interested, please join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/oppd-ietf).
* We will have a side meeting **in Dublin (IETF-121) on Thursday, 7 November 2024, in Wicklow Hall 2A, from 18:30 to 19:30**.
* **Agenda:**
  * **15 min** [presentation](slides/) to frame the discussion
  * **45 min** discussion about:
     1. Where should this work happen?
     2. Where should we do following work on performance enhancing functions?  (SMAQ / Sidekick / .. ?)
     3. Design of OPPD

* Remote coordinates: IETF-provided access [https://ietf.webex.com/meet/ietfsidemeeting2](https://ietf.webex.com/meet/ietfsidemeeting2)

## Who needs this?

* [SCONE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sconepro/about/) is now chartered; we think it will need OPPD.
* There are some research works that show a need, including:
  * Gina Yuan, Matthew Sotoudeh, David K. Zhang, Michael Welzl, David Mazières, Keith Winstein: "[Sidekick: In-Network Assistance for Secure End-to-End Transport Protocols](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi24/presentation/yuan)", Usenix NSDI '24, Santa Clara, CA, USA, 16-18 April 2024. *(Recipient of Outstanding paper award and Community award)*
  * M. Kosek, B. Spies and J. Ott, "[Secure Middlebox-Assisted QUIC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186363)", 2023 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking), Barcelona, Spain, 2023. [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08543)

## Where in the IETF / IRTF would this work fit?

We think that potential venues are:

* [SCONE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sconepro/about/) once it gets chartered - but we don't want to wait and get started with OPPD already.
* [TSVWG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tsvwg/about/)
* [IRTF PANRG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/panrg/about/)
